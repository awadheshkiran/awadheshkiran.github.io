In our evolving world, we find ourselves at a crossroads where the environment's future hangs in the balance. It is a future that demands a collective understanding and commitment to environmental stewardship, transcending the boundaries of age and profession. We must move beyond a paradigm where children are unable to scientifically comprehend critical environmental issues without advanced degrees. Likewise, we cannot rely solely on higher officials and activists to bear the burden of environmental responsibility. What we urgently require are solutions that champion the cause of nature over corporate profits.

Sustainable science and development should no longer be relegated to the periphery of education; it must become an indispensable subject for the generations to come. The passage of time has placed an unequivocal spotlight on the need for young and innovative minds to grasp the intricacies of our environmental challenges. For a nation like India, where the impact of environmental changes is acutely felt, fostering a heightened environmental consciousness among the youth is of paramount significance. While many are aware of environmental shifts, only a select few possess climate literacy.

The cultivation of sustainable science education should commence from early childhood, and there is a rationale behind this imperative. First and foremost, the youth of today hold the reins to tomorrow's destiny. Children equipped with climate literacy are poised to grow with the profound understanding that this universe belongs to all, emphasizing the importance of collective responsibility. Secondly, we aspire not for a society of mere bookworms but one characterized by engaged and informed citizens.

In a country where a substantial majority grapples with environmental complications, it is imperative that we address the root causes comprehensively. A significant portion of the populace still construes sustainable science as a rudimentary understanding of global warming, greenhouse effects, ozone layer depletion, and the like â€“ a notion perpetuated by the current education system. However, in the global context, this level of understanding falls far short of what is required.

Children should be educated in ecological matters, the conservation of natural resources, the protection of human rights, and ethical values. They should possess the ability to articulate the environmental and ecological ramifications of proposed projects within society. We inhabit a multicultural world, and it is essential that sustainable education incorporates the preservation of diverse values and traditions without infringing upon the rights and beliefs of others.

The campaign for sustainable development and environmental concern is not a recent phenomenon. Citizens from small islands have long been warning of the potential consequences of climate change, recognizing its far-reaching implications. Recently, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) took a pioneering step by making climate literacy education mandatory across its 109 accredited schools and course providers. Countries like India are in dire need of similar reforms. We now have a decade at most to transform our society to avert irreversible climate change, as cautioned by the United Nations.

The vision for the future must emanate from the youth. A collective endeavor to empower young minds in shaping the future has become paramount. The time is ripe for transformative reforms in our existing systems. Let us hold hope close to our hearts as we navigate these uncharted waters.

Thank you.
